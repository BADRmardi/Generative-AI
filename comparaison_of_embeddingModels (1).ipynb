Most of these employ conventional\\nglass-fronted panels, but this type of PV array does not satisfy applications that require a light-weight,\\nﬂexible PV generator. An option discussed in this article is to consider textiles for such solar cell\\nsubstrates. As explained in this review, combining the choice of PV cell type with the choice of\\ntextile offers alternative structures for ﬂexible PV cells. In particular, the relative advantages and\\ndisadvantages are contrasted, either forming PV-coated ﬁbres into a fabric, or coating an already\\nformed fabric with the PV materials. It is shown that combining thin-ﬁlm amorphous silicon\\nPV technology and woven polyester fabric offers one solution to realizing ﬂexible fabric PV cells,\\nusing well-understood coating methods from the textile and semiconductor industries. Finally a few\\napplications are presented that are addressed by this approach.\\nKeywords: photovoltaics; solar cells; textiles; thin-ﬁlm semiconductors\\n1. Introduction\\nTextile fabrics nowadays possess a multitude of applications. In addition to their obvious use as\\nmaterials for clothing, they have a wide variety of highly technical uses, ranging from conventional bulk\\nbags to sophisticated medical implants. Moreover, the miniaturisation of electronic devices over the\\npast twenty years or so has expanded textile applications still further. In particular, there is extensive\\ninterest in the incorporation of sensors into wearable fabrics: for example, for medical, military,\\nsports and leisure applications [ 1]. In this paper, we explore the innovative use of textiles as supports\\nfor electricity-generating photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, contrasting the different approaches that seek to\\nuse the performance of a fabric without compromising the operation of the solar cells. The simplest\\napproach, of bonding solar cells to a fabric, is less effective in retaining the textile properties than it\\nis in maintaining the solar cell performance. The other two approaches use contrasting architectures\\nfor integrating solar cells with fabrics: Either the cells are constructed on ﬁbres that are subsequently\\nfashioned into a fabric or the cells are formed on a ﬁnished fabric. Each of these techniques has its\\nadvantages and disadvantages, with rather more effort reported on making coated ﬁbres.\\nSolar PV is one of the alternative sustainable energy sources that make up increasing amounts\\nof electrical demand in many countries. In 2015, PV provided 1.2% of global electricity demand [ 2].\\nThe renewable sources available include hydroelectric schemes, wind turbines, wave power and tidal\\npower. However, the most compelling direct source of energy, and one that will provide an “endless”\\nsupply, is the sun. The sun provides the whole Earth with more energy in one hour than the world’s\\npopulation uses in one year. Despite its variability, in harnessing solar power, particular success has\\ncome from its direct conversion to electricity, using solar cells.\\nCoatings 2017 ,7, 63; doi:10.3390/coatings7050063 www.mdpi.com/journal/coatings'),\n",

These panels consist of interconnected solar cells applied to glass\\nor polycarbonate plates. Despite the success that such solar panels have achieved, they nevertheless\\npossess a number of drawbacks. They can be attached only to ﬂat surfaces. In addition, the plates\\nare heavy, and so the structures to which the panels are to be attached must be strong enough to\\nwithstand their weight. In addition, glass plates are fragile: care has to be taken with their storage and\\ntransport. To overcome these drawbacks, attention has increasingly been turned to the construction of\\nlighter, ﬂexible cells, which can withstand harsh environments, maintain durability and involve lower\\nmaterials use and reduced cost in their construction. An extensive commercial range of photovoltaic cells\\nnow exists that has been applied to thin plastic or metal films. These films are much lighter and generally\\ncost less to produce. However, the thinness of the films may still render them liable to fracture during\\nboth construction and application, so care has to be taken when they are attached to underlying structures.\\nTextile fabrics offer a solution to this difﬁculty, not least because they are the most widespread\\nﬂexible materials in everyday use. There is a huge range of textile constructions that can be produced\\nfrom woven, knitted, embroidered and nonwoven fabrics, comprising a wide choice of natural and\\nsynthetic ﬁbres that have been in use not just for centuries but for millennia [ 3]. Although used\\nprimarily for the provision of clothing, they have also in this time enjoyed extensive technical use,\\nfor example in sailcloth, tents and sacks. It is considered that the ancient Egyptians began to use cloth\\nsails as long ago as around 3000 BC. The role of textile fabrics as substrates for solar cells increases still\\nfurther their range of applications.\\nThe fabrics can be either ones that have been specially constructed for particular PV applications or,\\non the other hand, conventional fabrics adapted to be photovoltaic. Textile fabrics possess a very broad\\nrange of markets and applications, and can be produced by a wide variety of fabrication processes,\\nall of which provide enormous versatility for tailoring fabric shape and properties. In addition, there is\\nnow extensive interest in the integration of sensors into textile fabrics, such as in wearable technologies\\nand healthcare, an objective made attainable by the miniaturisation of electronic devices. These sensors\\nhave to be powered, either directly from external sources or via small battery intermediates. Either way,\\nit would be highly desirable that the energy harvester is also integrated into the textile, and a PV\\napproach can offer a means of achieving this goal. The combined use of solar cells, batteries and\\nsensors is an obvious extension.\\nAn additional advantage of textile substrates is their lower embedded energy (53 MJ ·m−2)\\ncompared with traditional glass (150–200 MJ ·m−2) plates. This impacts on the energy pay-back period,\\nwhich should be shorter than the panel lifetime if photovoltaics are to be real renewable energy sources:\\nwe have calculated a pay-back period for textile-based PV , in a modest solar climate, of 1–2 years\\nwhich is 2.5 times less than that of similar rigid panels [4].\\nNevertheless, in adopting textiles as substrates, several criteria have to be met. For example,\\nwill the textile substrate be able to withstand the processing conditions required to render it\\nphotovoltaic, and will the ﬁnished solar textile be able to withstand wear and tear in use, and also\\nwashing and drying cycles? Will any important physical and aesthetic features be compromised by\\nthe presence of solar cells? These considerations are taken into account in this article. The following'),\n",

Fortunately, silicon is close\\nto optimum for these competing trade-offs, as it is a well-known material with mature technology and\\nis an abundant element. In contrast, it has been developed as a precision material for microelectronics\\nrather than a low cost energy converter, so to reduce the cost of PV power, a thin-ﬁlm version has been\\nsought that would use less material. Such a choice generally comes with a reduction of performance.\\nA variety of thin-ﬁlm semiconductors have been proposed for low cost PV power, from inorganic\\ncompounds of several elements to organic molecules and polymers. These mostly lie at the opposite end\\nof the performance spectrum from single crystalline inorganic materials like Si or GaAs, but thin-ﬁlm\\nCdTe and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) are each capable of similar conversion efﬁciencies\\nto commercial Si cells. One of the earliest thin-ﬁlm PV options was “amorphous silicon”, which its\\nabbreviated name, a-Si:H, indicates is actually a combination of silicon and hydrogen. Its strong\\noptical absorption is an advantage for thin solar cells, but its poorer electrical properties counter this to\\nsome extent: photo-generated charge pairs can only diffuse a short distance before recombining again,\\nbut carrier separation is improved by introducing an electrical ﬁeld region with a double-junction\\n(P-I-N) structure that is wider than a simple P-N junction. Nonetheless, a-SiH cells can only\\nachieve ~10% efﬁciency but use relatively low temperature synthesis (~200◦C) in contrast to most\\nother inorganic semiconductors.\\nOrganic polymer PV materials challenge this with similar efﬁciency but simpler and lower\\ntemperature processing. The photoactive material may be a large organic molecule, such as a fullerene,\\nor a polymer, or a combination, although polymer types have dominated developments [ 6]. These have\\nrequired advanced polymer chemistry and highly dependable hermetic encapsulation to avoid rapid\\ndegradation in air or sunlight [ 7]. Hybrid organic/inorganic cells should be able to combine the optical\\nand electrical advantages of both types of material, but have sometimes shown poor carrier collection\\nunless the built-in electric ﬁeld was well designed (e.g., [ 8,9]) Organic cells differ from all inorganic\\ncells in producing electrical charge pairs that remain tied together (as excitons or polarons) as they\\nmove through the material, for instance by hopping along the conjugated bonds in polymer chains.\\nThis limitation is generally solved by a larger area, non-planar junction to reduce the distance travelled\\nand so separate the photogenerated charges more effectively. The liquid-based coating techniques\\nused for many organic materials are obviously well-suited to application on ﬁbres or textiles.\\nFor over 25 years, an alternative type of PV cell has been researched, the dye sensitized solar\\ncell (DSSC), which is strictly an electrochemical device [ 10]. By using a dye to absorb the sunlight,\\nthese cells should be better able to match the spectrum of the light source than a single semiconductor\\ntype of cell does, and placing the dye on the nano-structured surface of a transparent insulating\\nmaterial, such as TiO 2, separates the functions of optical absorption and electrical charge injection.\\nInsulators have a much larger threshold energy than semiconductors for optical absorption, and so\\ncan support a larger potential barrier, giving greater output voltage in a suitably constructed PV cell.\\nHowever, instead of a PN junction, the charge separation is facilitated by an electrolyte comprising a\\nredox couple in a solvent—for instance, iodine ions in an organic liquid or gel, in contact with the TiO 2.\\nA counter electrode of corrosion-resistant metal such as platinum completes the electrical circuit and'),\n",

However, during the past twenty years or so, embroidered structures\\nhave become increasingly used for high-tech applications, including those applications requiring\\nconductive textiles, such as intelligent sensors. Three kinds of embroidery methods are available:\\nChain-stitch, standard embroidery and tailored ﬁbre replacement (TFP). Chain-stitch, which is a\\none-thread system, produces a pattern with a moss-like surface. Standard embroidery is a two-thread\\nsystem, and the base fabric, on which the embroidered pattern is to be created, is held under tension on\\na frame. The frame is programmed to move in x- and y-directions, as required for the desired patterned\\nto be obtained. The TFP method extends standard embroidery by utilising a three-thread system,\\nand is the most versatile and precise method, as it allows for placement of the textile material using a\\nhighly controlled geometry. Three-dimensional structures can be created. Details of each method can\\nbe found elsewhere [17,18].\\n2.3. Making Fabrics Electrically Conducting\\nIt is evident that the top and bottom of any PV cell must be able to conduct electricity, as illustrated\\nin Figure 1. Moreover, the bottom layer of a textile PV cell has to be rendered conductive in a way that\\naffects the textile’s ﬂexibility as little as possible.\\nThere are in broad terms two ways in which fabrics can be made electrically conducting.\\nOne method is to ﬁrst make the constituent ﬁbres conducting before the fabric is constructed from\\nthem. The other method is to render an already constructed fabric conducting: either by (a) interlacing\\nconducting yarns into the fabric or by (b) depositing a thin conducting coating onto the fabric. The ﬁrst\\nmethod results in the production of customised fabrics, whereas the latter method can involve the\\nadaptation of an everyday, “off-the-shelf” fabric. We can consider the two approaches in turn.\\n2.3.1. Conductive Fibres\\nFrom the point of view of ﬁbre conductivity, perhaps the most straightforward approach is to\\nproduce metal wires, or, perhaps better, metal ﬁbres and to construct fabric from them. Metal wires\\nhave been classiﬁed as possessing diameters of 30–1400 µm, and metal ﬁbres as possessing diameters\\nof 2–40 µm [19]. Whether the fabric produced can be considered a textile or not is a matter of opinion!\\nSufﬁce to say, though, a metal fabric possesses very few of the physical properties normally associated\\nwith a textile. An alternative is to incorporate metal wires or ﬁbres into yarns during construction\\nof the fabric. The metal ﬁbres must be thin if the stiffness of the resulting fabric is not signiﬁcantly\\nincreased. They are then, however, liable to break under the rigorous conditions of practical fabric\\nconstruction, and also even in application, depending how demanding the application is. Moreover,\\nthere is the risk that contacts between the metal wires or ﬁbres may only be intermittent.\\nA number of polymers possess some electrical conductivity, though 2–3 orders of magnitude\\nlower than metals. Several of these intrinsically conducting polymers, such as polyaniline,\\npolypyrrole and polythiophene, can be converted into ﬁbres. Their mechanical performance is,\\nhowever, generally inadequate [ 20], and their ﬂexibility is quite limited [ 21]. Fibrous blends of these\\nconducting polymers with conventional polymers have been tested with some measure of success [ 21],\\nbut it is crucial that the conducting polymer can survive the conditions for producing yarn and\\nafterwards for constructing the fabric.\\nYet another approach to rendering a ﬁbre conducting is through deposition of metal or conductive\\npolymer onto the ﬁbre surface. Good conductivity is then achievable, without compromising bulk ﬁbre\\nproperties. Indeed, the art of winding precious metal strips around silk yarns to produce so-celled'),\n",

Good conductivity is then achievable, without compromising bulk ﬁbre\\nproperties. Indeed, the art of winding precious metal strips around silk yarns to produce so-celled\\nﬁléyarns has been practised for at least 2000 years and maybe even earlier. Fabrics consisting of\\nthese yarns were considered luxury items. Nowadays, metal coatings are commonly achieved by\\nvacuum deposition or sputter coating [ 22]. Conducting polymer may be deposited from a suspension\\nor solution by means of bulk polymerisation with the ﬁbres present [ 23], but better control is achieved\\nif the polymerisation occurs on the ﬁbre surface. After the adsorption of a layer of monomer, it is then'),\n",

The success of this method depends on the\\nextent and uniformity of adsorption of the monomer and on the resistance of the ﬁbres to the initiator,\\ninvariably an oxidising agent.\\nThe success of deposition methods depends too on how strongly the deposited metal or polymer\\nadheres to the ﬁbres. For example, the metal layer, being much stiffer than the underlying ﬁbre, is liable\\nto crack when the ﬁbre is ﬂexed. The continuity of the layer is hence broken and conductivity is lost.\\nMoreover, the metallic or polymeric coating has to withstand all the subsequent processes undergone\\nby the ﬁbre. These processes include both fabric construction and the subsequent conversion of\\nfabric into product. The conditions for the deposition of PV cells also have to be taken into account:\\nFor example, polymeric coatings must be stable at the elevated temperatures that may be required.\\nThe incorporation of carbon black or carbon nanotubes prior to ﬁbre extrusion can impart\\nconductivity to the ﬁbres produced, though the proportion of carbon required has to be at least\\n10%: Graphene is another highly conductive option for which a smaller concentration should be\\nsufﬁcient. At the 10% level, however, the ﬁbres stiffen, with the result that subsequent fabric\\nconstruction is rendered more difﬁcult [ 23]. Moreover, the black or grey appearance of the fabric may\\nbe aesthetically undesirable. The incorporation of metal particles in a similar way has also been used\\nto impart conductivity, but metal particles can in time abrade the holes in the spinneret used in the\\nextrusion process.\\n2.3.2. Conductive Fabrics\\nOf the two broad approaches to rendering fabrics electrically conducting, the integration of\\nconductive yarns into a fabric structure is the more complex and less uniform process. It has to be\\ntaken into account that the yarns comprising a fabric are interlaced, and that, at the points where they\\ninterlace, they are subjected to bending and compression. Therefore, those structures where bending\\nand compression are the least are liable to be the ones that are most desirable for conducting yarns [ 24].\\nFor woven fabrics, the best integration of conducting yarns is in some types of twill weave\\nstructures [ 24]. Knitted structures pose a greater problem: The yarns in both warp and weft structures\\nare subjected to severe bending in the loops, as shown in Figure 3. Indeed, the bends are so tight that\\nmechanical failure of the incorporated conducting yarn would very likely result. It is therefore risky to\\ninterlace conducting yarns in the same way as the component fabric yarns. Instead, the yarns are often\\nintegrated in straight lines that interlace with the loops of the fabric. Whilst this approach may render\\nthe fabric conducting, there is a danger of impairment to its physical and aesthetic character.\\nIn the case of nonwoven fabrics, imparting conductivity depends very much on the structure\\nof the fabric. In a nonwoven fabric that possesses clear layers, conductive yarns can be placed in\\nstraight lines between the layers. Where layers are not readily identiﬁable, the ease of incorporation is\\ngoverned to an appreciable extent by the nature of the fabric’s porous structure.\\nEmbroidery seems a way forward in producing conductive textile fabrics, in that a\\npre-programmed arrangement of conductive yarns can be created [ 25]. There has been interest, for\\nexample, in embroidered textile antennae for communication systems [ 26]. However, whilst embroidery\\ncould well prove to be a valuable way to impart conductivity to a fabric, it does render it more textured,\\na feature that could make deposition of PV layers more demanding. To the authors’ knowledge,\\nlittle has so far been attempted on rendering embroidered structures photovoltaic, but this approach\\nmay provide an avenue in the future.'),\n",

Conductivity can, for example, be conferred by printing a conductive ink\\nor paste onto the fabric. Conductive inks can be applied by ink-jet printing, a method that is now well\\nestablished as a decorative technique. The ink consists of nanoparticles of a highly conducting metal,\\nsuch as silver or copper, dispersed in a suitable liquid, normally an aqueous one. It is essential that\\nthere is a high level of dispersion stability, coupled with suitable viscosity and surface tension, and so'),\n",

Aggregation of the metal particles\\nwould lead to poorer print quality and also risk clogging in the ink-jet nozzles.\\nThe ink is deposited on the fabric as separate droplets, which, after drying, give rise to tiny\\nindependent zones of metal particles. These particles may then have to be sintered on the fabric\\nto provide continuous connectivity between them, but the elevated temperatures usually required\\nfor sintering may degrade the underlying fabric. Silver nanoparticles can be sintered at 180◦C [19],\\nso commodity fabrics made from polyester or nylon, for example, whose melt temperatures are well\\nabove 180◦C, are likely to be suitable. It is also important that the metal adheres well to the fabric,\\nas, for bending and folding, the fabric can induce cracking in the metal layer, with consequent loss of\\nconductivity. Spray deposition of silver nanowires has shown great promise as a technique to produce\\nsemitransparent electrodes [27] despite the tendency for unprotected silver to tarnish.\\nScreen printing, a historic process for the decorative printing of textile fabrics, can also be\\nadapted for conferring conductivity. The process requires the use of a metal paste, usually a silver\\npaste. The thickness of the paste on the fabric must be sufﬁcient to impart high enough conductivity,\\nand several passes are often required. As with ink-jet printing, once the paste has dried, it may crack\\non bending or folding of the fabric. Screen printed silver grids have been applied to the PEDOT\\n(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) anode contact of organic solar cells on polymer foil, to eliminate\\nITO and give increased cell efﬁciency [28].\\nAn alternative method that we are pioneering in our work on the direct integration of silicon PV\\ncells onto fabric is the direct deposition of a thin metal ﬁlm onto textile fabric. Indeed, the incorporation\\nof metal, and notably gold, goes back to the era of the ancient Egyptians and has been practised in India\\ntoo for some millennia. Such decorative effects are still fashion features today, both in clothing and\\nin interior design. Whilst this method can undoubtedly produce electrical conductivity at the fabric\\nsurface, care has to be taken that the complete surface is covered. This aspect is especially important for\\na rougher, textured surface like a textile fabric surface. In addition, as highlighted above, the deposited\\nmetal ﬁlm is susceptible to cracking, when the fabric is bent or folded. Conductivity is then lost.\\nTo obviate this difﬁculty, we deposit ﬁrst a thin layer of conducting polymer before depositing an\\naluminium ﬁlm on top of it. Since the polymer is more ﬂexible and more compatible with the fabric\\nsurface, sufﬁcient conductivity is still maintained across any cracks that appear in the metal ﬁlm [29].\\nMetal coatings on textile fabrics can be achieved by a variety of techniques [ 22,30].\\nThese techniques include vacuum deposition, ion plating and sputter coating. Electroless plating is\\nanother technique that has begun to attract interest in the textile sector and is widely used in a number\\nof other industries. It depends on the presence of a reducing agent, generally sodium hypophosphite,\\nwhich reduces metal ions to metal atoms that are then deposited on the fabric surface. Nickel is often\\nthe metal used in this process.\\n3. Photovoltaic Textiles\\nWith this introduction to photovoltaic cells and textile materials, it is feasible to consider how\\nthe two may be combined to produce an active solar electricity generator. As we have just explained,\\nthere is a big difference between smooth continuous surfaces, such as presented by glass or plastic\\nsheets, and the rough discontinuous surface presented by textiles, for carrying the layers of a PV cell\\narray.

For instance, woven fabrics offer a wide range of\\nconstructions that may be used to advantage, such as capturing more light than a smooth reﬂective\\nbacking sheet.\\n3.1. Photovoltaic Attachment\\nTextile fabrics rendered PV through attachment of a PV cell or PV ﬁlm are not strictly solar textiles,\\nin that they are merely a combination of a textile fabric and PV panels [ 31,32]. Nevertheless, it is\\nperhaps instructive to brieﬂy highlight approaches that have been applied adopting this strategy.\\nOne of these is simply the attachment to a textile fabric of a PV panel, though one that is not fragile.\\nSuch combinations are present, for example, in some bags and backpacks. In other examples, an array\\nof small individual cells, like sequins, is attached to the fabric. A more intimately single product unit\\nis obtained, using a combination of known technologies. No special adaptation of PV cells or fabric\\nis required, so a wide range of both can be chosen. However, the physical, mechanical and aesthetic\\nproperties of the fabric are very likely to be compromised. Moreover, the attachment of the cells and\\nthe electrical connections between them would be difﬁcult to achieve on a commercial scale.\\nTextile fabrics can be rendered photovoltaic by attaching PV ﬁlms to them, and many current\\nsolar textile products use this strategy. Thus, the technologies already developed for producing PV\\nﬁlms can be extended to solar textiles. In addition, the methods of attaching a thin ﬁlm to a fabric, e.g.,\\nsewing, welding and lamination, are all well established. However, we have already alluded to the\\nproblems with PV ﬁlms in the Introduction, and indeed it is also important that the PV ﬁlm is not\\nruptured during the attachment process. As with the addition of PV cells, the properties of the fabric\\nmay well be compromised.\\nKrebs et al. [ 33] adopted the strategy of incorporating polymer PVs on fabric. One adaptation of\\ntheir strategy was the incorporation directly onto a fabric of a polymer PV on a polyester substrate.\\nAnother adaptation was notably more complex. It initially comprised the lamination of a thin layer\\nof polyethylene onto a fabric and then, after plasma treatments of the layer, the application of a\\nPEDOT electrode. The next stage was screen printing of the polymer PV and ﬁnally deposition of a\\nfurther electrode. Krebs et al. [ 33] reported that the resultant fabrics performed well, though they were\\nsusceptible to degradation resulting from exposure to oxygen and water vapour, as is common with\\npolymeric PV devices generally.\\n3.2. Photovoltaic Fibres\\nFor direct deposition of PV cells, the ﬁbre material must be chosen to withstand the processing\\nconditions of the various layers required. For thin ﬁlm semiconducting compounds, this generally\\nneeds a high temperature material, but most organic cells and some inorganic cells may be produced\\nat close to room temperature or at least below 200◦C. If this restriction is not acceptable, then high\\ntemperature ﬁbres are required, such as metal, carbon, glass or polyimide, whereas up to 200◦C, it is\\npossible to use polyester or some nylons.\\nPerhaps the main drawback of using a photovoltaic-coated ﬁbre is its subsequent ability to be\\nformed into a fabric by weaving or knitting, with the attendant friction of the process placing big\\ndemands on the coating durability. Even if this is not a problem, the fabric topology must allow access\\nto both electrical contacts of the coating on each ﬁbre. This cannot be at the ends of long ﬁbres because\\nit would make the series resistance too high, limiting the current, so a scheme is needed to allow\\nconnections between separate smaller ﬁbre cells on each longer woven or knitted ﬁbre (It is usual to\\nconnect photovoltaic cells in series strings to sum the small voltages from each cell.).

However, the improved performance and solid-state structure of perovskite\\nPV cells has been tested in a ﬁbre conﬁguration (e.g., [ 42]), albeit on a stainless steel wire, using a\\nsingle step solution process for the active layer. Both types of electrochemical PV cell have similar\\nconcerns for stability.\\nThere is yet a big step between PV ﬁbres and a PV fabric: The assembly of ﬁbres into a two- or\\nthree-dimensional structure requires the ﬁbres to withstand twisting, stretching, and abrasion, all of\\nwhich have yet to be greatly tested. In particular, the easily coated organic PV materials tend to\\nbe sensitive to moisture, oxygen, UV and abrasion, so that effective hermetic sealing is a necessity.\\nBedeloglu et al.

However, a further\\npaper from these researchers explains further how to include DSSC cells in a woven glass yarn\\ntextile: the cells used perforated, dye-loaded, TiO 2-coated stainless steel ribbon photoanodes (weft)\\nand Pt-coated carbon yarn counterelectrodes (warp), with an acetonitrile electrolyte injected into a\\nlaminating plastic pouch after the cells had been inserted into the glass textile [ 45].

Different weaves\\nand different combinations of ﬁbre diameter and spacing were tested, although simple plain-weave\\nwas the best performer at a little over 1% efﬁciency. Moreover, cells could be connected in series and\\nparallel arrangements to step-up voltage or current according to requirements.\\nThe cylindrical shape of ﬁbre PV cells may offer less sensitivity to the illumination direction than\\nconventional planar cells, but ﬁbres will be non-uniformly illuminated across their diameter, and may\\nbe shadowed in a woven construction. A more easily handled shape between planar and ﬁbre is\\npresented by Krebs et al. [ 32] as PV tape. The Danish group’s sustained development of organic PV\\ncells by printing and roll-to-roll coating has shown that cells may be rapidly produced on long webs,\\nwith the ability to build-in series connections for strings of cells, and are suitable for cutting into tapes\\nfor further assembly. They have woven 10 mm wide organic PV tapes as weft with woven polyester\\ntapes having embedded silver wires as warp, producing 25 ×25 cm2sample textiles. Each strip of PV\\ntape had 16 cells in a series string, several tapes being aligned in parallel and connected together along\\neach side of the web to provide a positive terminal at one side and a negative terminal at the other:\\nThe output was 7.9 V open circuit or 114 mA short circuit, with an efﬁciency of about 1%. As the tapes\\ncould be hermetically sealed before weaving, and as the cells are readily connected or separated at the\\ngaps between them, this scheme offers an effective way of producing a true designer PV fabric.\\n3.3. Photovoltaic Fabrics\\nCoating an already fashioned fabric avoids the restrictions of processing coated ﬁbres and of\\ndesigning ﬁbre-level interconnections between small cells, although with the same temperature\\nrestrictions. It does, however, present a rough texture for the multilayer coatings to be added, and will\\nusually offer a complex surface that shifts as the individual yarns move over each other. This suggests\\nthat a big aim of any PV fabric design will be to ensure electrical continuity across the fabric as it ﬂexes.\\nA simple ﬁrst step has been to coat the fabric with a ﬁller that levels the rough texture and ﬁlls in the\\nspaces between ﬁbres. This approach was taken by Plentz et al. [ 48] who produced low efﬁciency\\namorphous silicon PV cells on glass ﬁbre fabrics having a dip-coating of polymer before the usual PV\\nlayers were applied, although cracking was mentioned as a potential problem. Higher efﬁciencies\\nwere achieved with CIGS cells deposited on to glass ﬁbre fabric pre-coated with particle-ﬁlled resin\\nthat withstood the high processing temperatures of this type of cell [ 49]. Both of these inorganic PV\\ncells use vacuum processes to apply the semiconductor: thermal evaporation of elements for CIGS and\\nplasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition for a-Si:H. The electrical contacts are commonly applied\\nby sputtering in a partial vacuum, whether they are metallic or a conducting transparent oxide.\\nThe more usual fabric materials demand low temperatures, which suggests organics or\\nDSSC-types of PV rather than inorganic semiconductors. However, as mentioned in Section 2.1\\nabove, amorphous silicon is still an option, as it may be formed at 200◦C by plasma enhanced\\nchemical vapour deposition (PECVD) from gaseous sources of Si and the dopants for the other two\\nlayers, enabling several commodity textiles to be used. We chose woven polyester for our ﬂexible PV\\ndevices [ 50] because it is stable to over 200◦C in vacuum, is UV resistant, and is available in large\\namounts, with a choice of weaves and ﬁbre sizes.

The effect for thin N-I-P thin-ﬁlm silicon cells has been investigated\\nfor glass substrates with random-textured TCO layers overcoated with silver: Angular reﬂection\\nmeasurements were made for different laser wavelengths [ 51]. Although the more complicated\\nbehavior of the multi-layers in complete solar cells includes the effects of refractive index changes at\\nthe interfaces as well as layer thicknesses, this textured back surface did have a dominant effect on\\nlight trapping within the cell. For smooth layers, the planar structure of thin cells can also trap light as\\nguided waves, according to the angle of incidence, although the angular dependence may be reduced\\nby employing a periodic pattern along the layer thickness [ 52]. Absorption with the randomly rough\\nsurfaces found in practice may be enhanced by adding photonic structures, even with modest spatial\\nfeatures which do not detract from the desired electrical properties of the layers [ 53]. Full photonic\\nlight trapping generally requires periodic structural elements with nanosized features (e.g., [ 54–56])\\nthat are difﬁcult to fabricate on a textile surface, but some degree of light trapping is still feasible\\neven with disordered nanostructures and these do have less sensitivity than coherent light trapping\\nstructures to the acceptance angle of the light (e.g., [57,58]).\\n4. Technological Speciﬁcations\\nIt will now be apparent that specifying a textile-based PV power source offers a wide range of\\noptions for the basic construction, as well as for the PV cell shapes, sizes, and their interconnection\\ninto a PV array. The starting point has to be consideration of the application and its power demand:\\nis it possible to supply this by PV alone, or will batteries also be required? Integrating thin batteries\\ninto a PV textile has been proposed, with some loss of fabric handle and drape, and is possible for low\\npower demands, such as for sensors or portable electronics items. Further attention should be given to\\nthe choice of materials (both environmental and economic issues) and to the thermal limitations of\\nthe fabric (process energy cost and processing stability). In addition, the application will have its own\\nrequirements for operating conditions and perhaps for washing or cleaning if the fabric is to form part\\nof clothing or furnishings.\\nWe should also take into account the effects of incorporating PV cells on the properties of the\\nfabric itself. It is evident that the surface character of the fabric will necessarily be altered by the\\nincorporation of PV cells, and indeed the deposited PV cells are liable to be highly susceptible to\\nexternal conditions. For this reason, the PV fabric surface has to be suitably protected, depending on\\nthe application for which it is destined. For an outside use such as tents, the robust resin coating that\\nis used on tent fabrics will also have to protect the PV cells on it. For an indoor application, such as\\ncurtains, where conditions are expected to be more clement, the protective layer can be thin, so that\\ndrape in particular is not compromised.\\nAlthough surface character will be altered, the factors comprising the bulk properties of the fabric\\nshould be affected as little as possible. These factors include ﬁbre composition, yarn construction,\\nfabric construction and, particularly in the case of nonwovens, porous nature. It is clear too that the\\nconstruction and properties of the products made from PV fabrics should also be unaffected. For some\\nparticular applications, there will be further speciﬁcations.

In order to manufacture these devices on fabrics,\\nit would be helpful if the methods were familiar to the textile industry, or alternatively, if there was\\nexpertise within the electronics industries of handling rolls of ﬂexible materials. Neither of these\\ncircumstances is common. However, the textile industry is accustomed to liquid coating of rolls of\\nmaterial and has been looking to gas-based processes, including plasma treatments, to reduce the\\nneed to handle large quantities of liquid waste (e.g., [ 60]). Roll-to-roll coating is also used for plastic\\npackaging, and for some solar cells on polymer ﬁlm. Researchers in Germany proposed a scheme\\nwith moveable-wire masking to fabricate PECVD amorphous silicon solar cells on plastic sheets [ 61]\\nthat could be used with a roll-to-roll system (Figure 8). Uni Solar Inc.

Around the same time,\\nKrebs showed how organic solar cells may be fabricated on a polymer ﬁlm without vacuum processes,\\nusing all solution-based layers, that would be suitable for roll-to-roll production [ 62]. However,\\nmore development is needed for handling the very ﬂexible textile materials in a controlled manner\\nfor precise coating with solar cell over-layers.

Solar sails are being devised to power electronic devices in sailing boats.\\nIdeally, a PV generator needs to be functionally integrated with a device for storing electricity,\\nsuch as a battery or supercapacitor, which, in turn, is linked to the device to be powered.\\nThe miniaturisation of electronic devices has sparked real interest in their incorporation into textiles.\\nHowever, although tiny sensors have been successfully used in textiles and energy storage devices\\nare now also becoming capable of being used in textiles, the challenge of energy supply devices is\\nstill regarded as tricky. The direct integration of amorphous silicon PV cells, however, such as we are\\nattempting, represents one realistic response to this challenge.\\nAcknowledgments: We are grateful to Danmei Sun and Lisa Macintyre from Heriot-Watt University\\n(Scottish Borders Campus, Galashiels, Scotland) for providing schematic diagrams of woven fabrics and knitted\\nfabrics respectively.\\nAuthor Contributions: Robert R. Mather and John I. B. Wilson both conceived and designed the experiments,\\nanalyzed the data, and wrote the paper.\\nConﬂicts of Interest: The authors declare no conﬂict of interest.\\nReferences\\n1.
